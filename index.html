                        <h1>What is Depression?</h1>
<p>Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the
    way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss
    of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease
    a person’s ability to function at work and at home.</p>
